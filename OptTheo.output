Class scrbook Warning: Usage of deprecated font command `\sl'!

(scrbook)              been defined for compatiblitiy to Script 2.0 only.
(scrbook)              Now, after two decades of LaTeX2e and NFSS2, you
(scrbook)              shouldn't use such commands any longer and within
(scrbook)              KOMA-Script usage of `\sl' is definitely deprecated.
